This project analyzes jail booking data regarding ICE and other federal holds, testing the hypothesis that ICE holds for local detainees lead to increased jail time.

This public repository reflects the state of this project at the time of publication of the January 30, 2019 version of the report "Unequal Justice: Measuring the Impact of ICE Detainers on Jail Time in Pierce County". This repository may be updated with bugfixes or corrections, but further analysis will proceed in a private repository maintained by [@philneff](https://github.com/philneff).
